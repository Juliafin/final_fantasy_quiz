1. V Attach an event listener on the main submit buttons
2. V When the welcome scrren submit button is pressed, increment a counter for the question (also used as an index to push the answers) Create 4 divs for the answer boxes, one for the question, and one for the question counter, and a button for question submits. Also delete the button on the press.
V * Implemented alternate solution involving different data structures : 3. Make a state object with 4 Separate arrays of answers, and also 4 separate arrays for answer letters (one of them being an answer key)
4. V Use the counter to push indexes of those 5 arrays and concatenate them with a letter at the beginning.
5. * This was optional * use regex to parse the letter at the beginning, and push them into the appropriate div
6. When the submit is pressed, a click must be registered on one of the boxes (also turning that box green with an alpha gradient ).
7. Make sure that only one box can be clicked at a time (by removing the "selected" class from the buttons that are not clicked.)
8. Use the event.target to determine which element was clicked.
9. Add an if statement for submit buttons that tests whether a button is currently selected
10. When the submit button is pressed,
parse the selected box, and check whether the content of the answer div selected answer matches at the current index for the answer array. Do this by using regex to strip the (A., B., C., D.) from the div text, matching it against the current index of the answer key (if statement)
11. If it does, increment the "questions right" in the question box. Then flash the divs not selected with a red alpha gradient.
12. On the last submit button press (add an if statement on the current index), remove the quiz divs, and create a new set of divs showing the user their result, and congratulating the user for making it through the quiz. Also, the last question is free no matter what, so match the result regardless (if statement on the last question)
